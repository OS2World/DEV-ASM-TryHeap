Since TRYHEAP is presented here in DOS and OS/2 forms, some of the 
files have been renamed in order to distingish them.  The DOS forms of 
TRYHEAP, TRYHEAP.EXE, and TRYHEAP.ASM have been renamed TRYHEAPD, 
TRYHEAPD.EXE, and TRYHEAPD.ASM.  When you use these files in DOS, 
however, you should rename them to their original names.  Similarly, 
the OS/2 forms of TRYHEAP, TRYHEAP.DEF, TRYHEAP.ASM, and TRYHEAP.EXE 
have been renamed TRYHEAPO, TRYHEAPO.DEF, TRYHEAPO.ASM, and 
TRYHEAPO.EXE.  When you use them in OS/2, you should rename these files
to their original names as well.
